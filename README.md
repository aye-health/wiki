Understanding the needs. This will help to build out the features of the platform

### <a name="brainstorming-medical-records"></a>Patient Medical Records
*Issue:* We lose so much of our time and effort for getting general health&medical service. waiting for medical check up,then medical test of blood,sugar,urine, x-ray etc from different labs and again re appointment with all test report for getting prescription, go to medical stores, waiting for medicine, again consult with pharmacist for doses. This process again to be continued when we go for next check up. If we have multiple health problems then we face more problems in multiple prescriptions. A person also may have a disease that he/she has been facing for a long time and is getting treatment for years on end. Having a digital copy of all the medical records attached to some form of identification on a database would be very helpful for that person who is seeking medical help.

*Solve:* Regardless of where the patient is located, a doctor can access  details for patient treatment rather than patient carrying all documents with him/her, misplacing them and having no record of it at all. This could also help doctors keep track of all the prior medication and treatments given to the patient as well as the all the test results so that a lot of resources are saved by the patient and most importantly time and money. While at the ambulance records can automatically pulled up and updates the hospital, so before patient arrives, Doctors and nurses are ready. Contact person for emergency will be available. Accurate and Less human errors and ambulance can get a quick recovery of the following personal and medical records of a person during emergency situations like an accident or an attack of life threatening illness. This is very useful, Thus, even if the person had gone unconscious or unable to talk about itself and its condition.

### <a name="brainstorming-medical-prescriptions"></a>Patient Prescriptions
*Issue :* Patients must visit doctor in order to get their prescriptions.

*Solve:* Through e-mail and platform, doctors or the patients can connect with other doctors to get authorized prescription drugs.

### <a name="brainstorming-medical-polypharmacy"></a>Polypharmacy

*Issue:* Polypharmacy is defined as the effects of taking multiple medications by patients concurrently to manage co-existing health issues. Polypharmacy becomes problematic, dangerous, and ineffective when these drugs interacts with one another and/or contribute life threatening adverse events. It becomes extremely difficult for pharmacists and physicians to intervene when multiple drugs are being dispensed at multiple pharmacies.

*Solve:* A free mobile app that is built like financial accounts (ie. mint), to allow consumers to access all their prescriptions and medications when they are logged in. Upon initial set up, app will access all prescription data from associated pharmacy accounts (ie. CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Medco Express Scripts, Humana, ect.,)

Ways this mobile app can eliminate the polypharmacy effect: will have the capabilities to analyze drug interactions and adverse events, can assists physicians and pharmacists in getting the bigger picture for a patient's medication history, can remind patients with pill burdens to take medications on time (as an attempt to increase patient's compliance)

### <a name="brainstorming-doctor-availability"></a>Doctor Availablity

*Issue:* Scheduling with a Doctor is currently a private process where doctors will develop their own appointment booking apps for their patients to let them know their availability and give an option to book an appointment, making it harder for new patients to fit into schedule.

*Solve:* Platform for both patients and doctors where patients can search a database of doctors and medical centers near them. These doctors can be filtered on the basis of what ailment you want to consult a doctor for. Once you have a list of doctors you can select any one of them on the basis of user reviews and ratings in order to schedule a call, or book an appointment for visit.

### <a name="brainstorming-medication-reminders"></a>Medication Reminders

*Issue:* There are times when people have so many prescriptions they can hardly keep track of them all, and that can be deadly. Apps can be used to track medication intake, set reminders for dosage and time, with the help of a special tracking, will even notify caregivers if a dosage is missed. These apps are not all singularly focused. Existing reminder options require user input and if that user forgets to update the system in line with changes to their prescription, then medication reminders aren't relevant to their required medical routine.

*Solve:* A web based application that 'plugs into' doctor or pharmacy systems to enable medication reminders to be sent to patients by SMS, email and/or push notifications. This means doses of medication aren't missed and the correct medication is taken at the right time.

## <a name="brainstorming-wearable-analysis"></a>Wearable Analysis

*Issue:* Lack of continuous health updates that measures people\u2019s energy levels as well as their health, mental, emotional, psychological and physical states. Doctors can tell a whole lot about a person\u2019s health conditions simply by measuring their heartbeats.

*Solve:* Apps connected to wearable devices. A high blood pressure patient can be prescribed a wrist monitor, which takes blood pressure throughout the day and transmits the data to a smartphone app. The app sends the readings directly to the doctor. \u201cPortable blood-pressure monitors have been around for a while. But the idea of linking a tiny, wearable one to a smartphone and a software app is an example of how entrepreneurs are harnessing wireless technology to create innovative services.\u201d

## <a name="brainstorming-second-opinion"></a>Second Opinions

*Issue:* Patients must visit multiple locations to have second opinions made.

*Solve:* Patients can upload their documents/records and get opinion about various treatments available. What\u2019s the need? Let\u2019s take an example of dental patient from USA. He needs to get one missing tooth replaced. Now a tooth can be replaced by several ways (removable, fixed, implants), but dentists suggest most expensive option, if he consults another Dentist, he will also go for the same treatment plan. Here we can give him an independent opinion. Similarly many cardiac patients do not require stent placement, but due to lack of awareness and greed of medics, they undergo this expensive and invasive treatment.
